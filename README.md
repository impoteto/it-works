Keeping a separate list of VPN configurations that have been tested manually for each mobile network operator in Iran

Thank you for these great repoos for providing and aggregating configurations, without these lists, I wouldn't be able to carry tests in first place!

**why?**

well, mostly for personal use, so I can use it as subscription link, since most lists on the internet are aggregations and quite lengthy , I thought it's a good idea to seperate them by operator

I probably would think of a way to automate this in future (even though that would quite hard, since I have to switch between operators one way or another)
but for now, It would suffice to do it manually until a better solution emerges(I just said emerge huh)

maybe some people also find it useful
