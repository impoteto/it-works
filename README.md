Keeping a separate list of VPN configurations that have been tested manually for each mobile network operator in Iran

**Protocols**

VMESS - VLESS

Thank you for these great repoos for aggregating configurations, without these lists, I wouldn't be able to carry tests in first place!

**why?**

Well, mostly for personal use, so I can use it as subscription link, since most lists on the internet are aggregations and quite lengthy, I thought it's a good idea to separate them by mobile ISP

I probably would think of a way to automate this in the future (even though that would be quite difficult, since I have to switch between mobile ISPs one way or another), but for now, it would suffice to do it manually until a better solution emerges.

also, it would reflect actual performance a bit better since myself would prefer good performing configurations as much as possible

maybe some people also find it useful
