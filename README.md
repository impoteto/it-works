Keeping a separate list of VPN configurations that have been tested manually for each mobile network operator in Iran

**Protocols**

VMESS - VLESS

Thank you for these great repoos for aggregating configurations, without these lists, I wouldn't be able to carry tests in first place!

[TelegramV2RayCollector - yebkhe](https://github.com/yebekhe/TelegramV2rayCollector)

**why?**

well, mostly for personal use, so I can use it as subscription link, since most lists on the internet are aggregations and quite lengthy , I thought it's a good idea to seperate them by operator

I probably would think of a way to automate this in future (even though that would quite hard, since I have to switch between operators one way or another)
but for now, It would suffice to do it manually until a better solution emerges(I just said emerge huh)

also, it would reflect actual performance a bit better since myself would prefer good performing configurations as much as possible

maybe some people also find it useful
